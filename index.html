                Before embracing my "techie" indentity, I was a wandering soul looking for somewher eto belong. I have been in many different industies and many possitions to find what I really wanted to do. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was left to work as a Independent Contractor/ Driver for Doordash. In 2022, I decided to start my new journey through Thiknful Bootcamp to become a software; and I have found so much satisfication in the challenges, the puzzles, and he results of creating something that can possibly be a stepping stone to moving the direction of the world.
