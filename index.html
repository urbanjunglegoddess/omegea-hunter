                Before embracing my "techie" indentity, I was a wandering soul looking for somewher eto belong. I have been in many different industies and many possitions to find what I really wanted to do. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was left to work as a Independent Contractor/ Driver for Doordash. In 2022, I decided to start my new journey through Thiknful Bootcamp to become a software; and I have found so much satisfication in the challenges, the puzzles, and he results of creating something that can possibly be a stepping stone to moving the direction of the world.

            <h3>Working </h3>
            <p> I have not worked in many traditional 9-5 hourly jobs as these jobs were never appealing to me. So, working with others honestly will be a partially new thing for me. I have not been on many teams before and I have no idea what to really expect. I like working jobs where I have to prove myself. These jobs give me great satisfaction as my goal is to be better than I was yesterday. The jobs where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> There are no time constraints but 
                 when the work needs to be done</li>
                    <li>Micromanaging is an obsolete factor</li> 
                    <li>And flexiblilty is a priorty</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>are the types of jobs I apply myself to. Being able to maneuver in life comfortably is very important to me. I love traveling with my children going to see new things and becoming students of the world's many places. Having a job that can support me and my little family is beneficial an necessary.</p>
